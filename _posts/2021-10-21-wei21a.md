abstract: 'Intraoperative adverse events (iAEs) increase rates of postoperative mortality
  and morbidity. Identifying iAEs is important to quality assurance and postoperative
  care, but requires expertise, is time consuming, and expensive. Automated or partially-automated
  techniques are, therefore, desirable. Previous work showed that conventional image
  processing has not worked well with real-world laparoscopic videos. We present a
  novel modular deep learning system that can partially automate the process of iAE
  screening using videos of laparoscopic procedures. The system consists of a stabilizer
  to reduce camera motion, a spatiotemporal feature extractor, and a multi-stage temporal
  convolutional neural network to detect adverse events. We apply a novel focal-uncertainty
  smoothing loss to handle class imbalance and to address multi-task uncertainty.
  The system is evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation on a large (228 hours) dataset
  of laparoscopic videos, and we perform ablation studies to investigate the effects
  of stabilization and focal-uncertainty loss. Our system achieves an AUROC of 0.952,
  an average precision (AP) of 0.626 in thermal injury detection, and an AUROC of
  0.823 and an AP of 0.336 in bleeding detection. Our novel modular deep learning
  system outperforms conventional deep learning baselines. The model can be used as
  a screening tool to search for high risk events and to provide feedback for operation
  quality improvements and postoperative care. Source code available on GitHub: https://github.com/ICSSresearch/IAE-video.'
