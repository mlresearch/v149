abstract: In medical dialogue summarization, summaries must be coherent and must capture
  all the medically relevant information in the dialogue. However, learning effective
  models for summarization require large amounts of labeled data which is especially
  hard to obtain. We present an algorithm to create synthetic training data with an
  explicit focus on capturing medically relevant information. We utilize GPT-3 as
  the backbone of our algorithm and scale 210 human labeled examples to yield results
  comparable to using 6400 human labeled examples (âˆ¼30x) leveraging low-shot learning
  and an ensemble method. In detailed experiments, we show that this approach produces
  high quality training data that can further be combined with human labeled data
  to get summaries that are strongly preferable to those produced by models trained
  on human data alone both in terms of medical accuracy and coherency.
