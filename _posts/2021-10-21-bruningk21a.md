abstract: On high-resolution structural magnetic resonance (MR) images Alzheimer’s
  disease (AD) is pathologically characterised by brain atrophy and an overall loss
  of brain tissue connectivity. In this study, we harness such prior clinical domain
  knowledge to evaluate MR image-based classification of AD patients from healthy
  controls using deliberately simple convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures.
  In addition to evaluating CNN performance on high resolution structural MR imaging
  data, we consider topological feature representations thereof to evaluate structural
  connectivity. We perform an ablation study, combined with model interpretability
  analysis, to evaluate the relevance of the specific image region used for classification.
  Notably, we find that by choosing a meaningful data representation comprising the
  left hippocampus, we achieve competitive performance (accuracy 84 ± 7%) comparable
  to far more complex, heavily parameterised machine learning architectures. This
  implies that clinical domain knowledge may overrule the importance of model architecture
  design in the case of AD classification. This opens up new possibilities for interpretable
  architectures and simplifies model training in terms of computational cost and hardware
  requirements.
