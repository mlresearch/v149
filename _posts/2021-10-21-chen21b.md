abstract: State of the art techniques for creating ML models in healthcare often require
  large quantities of clean, labelled data. However, many healthcare organizations
  lack the capacity to generate the large-scale annotations required to create and
  validate reliable labels. In this paper, we demonstrate how raw data from an information-rich
  area of care can be exploited without the need for mass manual annotation via the
  use of weak labels. We evaluate the AF Detection with Weak Labels proposed framework
  on telemetry data from the intensive care unit for application of atrial fibrillation
  (AF) detection. We generate an in-house dataset of over 60,000 ECG segments with
  weak labels, derived from a model trained on publicly available data. We then show
  that building a deep learning model based on these weakly generated labels can significantly
  improve (more than 30%) the performance of AF detection in comparison with only
  using limited expert-annotated ground truth labels. We further demonstrate how weakly
  supervised learning techniques can be used to augment and control the level of noise
  in these weak labels. Lastly, we explore how supervised fine-tuning effects the
  performance of these models and discuss the viability of leveraging weak labels
  for large-scale atrial fibrillation detection and identification.
