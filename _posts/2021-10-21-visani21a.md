abstract: We address the problem of modeling constrained hospital resources in the
  midst of the COVID-19 pandemic in order to inform decision-makers of future demand
  and assess the societal value of possible interventions. For broad applicability,
  we focus on the common yet challenging scenario where patient-level data for a region
  of interest are not available. Instead, given daily admissions counts, we model
  aggregated counts of observed resource use, such as the number of patients in the
  general ward, in the intensive care unit, or on a ventilator. In order to explain
  how individual patient trajectories produce these counts, we propose an aggregate
  count explicit-duration hidden Markov model, nicknamed the ACED-HMM, with an interpretable,
  compact parameterization. We develop an Approximate Bayesian Computation approach
  that draws samples from the posterior distribution over the modelâ€™s transition and
  duration parameters given aggregate counts from a specific location, thus adapting
  the model to a region or individual hospital site of interest. Samples from this
  posterior can then be used to produce future forecasts of any counts of interest.
  Using data from the United States and the United Kingdom, we show our mechanistic
  approach provides competitive probabilistic forecasts for the future even as the
  dynamics of the pandemic shift. Furthermore, we show how our model provides insight
  about recovery probabilities or length of stay distributions, and we suggest its
  potential to answer challenging what-if questions about the societal value of possible
  interventions.
