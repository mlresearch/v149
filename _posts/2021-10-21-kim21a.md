abstract: Prediction of medical codes from clinical notes is both a practical and
  essential need for every healthcare delivery organization within current medical
  systems. Automating annotation will save significant time and excessive effort spent
  by human coders today. However, the biggest challenge is directly identifying appropriate
  medical codes out of several thou- sands of high-dimensional codes from unstructured
  free-text clinical notes. In the past three years, with Convolutional Neural Networks
  (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LTSM) networks, there have been vast improvements
  in tackling the most challenging benchmark of the MIMIC-III-full-label inpatient
  clinical notes dataset. This progress raises the fundamental question of how far
  automated machine learning (ML) systems are from human coders’ working performance.
  We assessed the baseline of human coders’ performance on the same subsampled testing
  set. We also present our Read, Attend, and Code (RAC) model for learning the medical
  code assignment mappings. By connecting convolved embeddings with self-attention
  and code-title guided attention modules, combined with sentence permutation-based
  data augmentations and stochastic weight averaging training, RAC establishes a new
  state of the art (SOTA), considerably outperforming the current best Macro-F1 by
  18.7%, and reaches past the human-level coding baseline. This new milestone marks
  a meaningful step toward fully autonomous medical coding (AMC) in machines reaching
  parity with human coders’ performance in medical code prediction.
