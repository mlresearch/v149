abstract: The widespread availability of high-dimensional electronic healthcare record
  (EHR) datasets has led to significant interest in using such data to derive clinical
  insights and make risk pre- dictions. More specifically, techniques from machine
  learning are being increasingly applied to the problem of dynamic survival analysis,
  where updated time-to-event risk predictions are learned as a function of the full
  covariate trajectory from EHR datasets. EHR data presents unique challenges in the
  context of dynamic survival analysis, involving a variety of decisions about data
  representation, modeling, interpretability, and clinically meaningful evaluation.
  In this paper we propose a new approach to dynamic survival analysis which addresses
  some of these challenges. Our modeling approach is based on learning a global parametric
  distribution to represent population characteristics and then dynamically locating
  individuals on the time-axis of this distribution conditioned on their histories.
  For evaluation we also propose a new version of the dynamic C-Index for clinically
  meaningful evaluation of dynamic survival models. To validate our approach we conduct
  dynamic risk prediction on three real-world datasets, involving COVID-19 severe
  outcomes, cardiovascular disease (CVD) onset, and primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC)
  time-to-transplant. We find that our proposed modeling approach is competitive with
  other well-known statistical and machine learning approaches for dynamic risk prediction,
  while offering potential advantages in terms of interepretability of predictions
  at the individual level.
