abstract: Digital contact tracing apps for COVID-19, such as the one developed by
  Google and Apple, need to estimate the risk that a user was infected during a particular
  exposure, in order to decide whether to notify the user to take precautions, such
  as entering into quarantine, or requesting a test. Such risk score models contain
  numerous parameters that must be set by the public health authority. In this paper,
  we show how to automatically learn these parameters from data. Our method needs
  access to exposure and outcome data. Although this data is already being collected
  (in an aggregated, privacy-preserving way) by several health authorities, in this
  paper we limit ourselves to simulated data, so that we can systematically study
  the different factors that affect the feasibility of the approach. In particular,
  we show that the parameters become harder to estimate when there is more missing
  data (e.g., due to infections which were not recorded by the app), and when there
  is model misspecification. Nevertheless, the learning approach outperforms a strong
  manually designed baseline. Furthermore, the learning approach can adapt even when
  the risk factors of the disease change, e.g., due to the evolution of new variants,
  or the adoption of vaccines.
