abstract: 'Machine learning models — now commonly developed to screen, diagnose, or
  predict health conditions — are evaluated with a variety of performance metrics.
  An important first step in assessing the practical utility of a model is to evaluate
  its average performance over a population of interest. In many settings, it is also
  critical that the model makes good predictions within predefined subpopulations.
  For instance, showing that a model is fair or equitable requires evaluating the
  model’s performance in different demographic subgroups. However, subpopulation performance
  metrics are typically computed using only data from that subgroup, resulting in
  higher variance estimates for smaller groups. We devise a procedure to measure subpopulation
  performance that can be more sample-efficient than the typical estimator. We propose
  using an evaluation model — a model that describes the conditional distribution
  of the predictive model score — to form model-based metric (MBM) estimates. Our
  procedure incorporates model checking and validation, and we propose a computationally
  efficient approximation of the traditional nonparametric bootstrap to form confidence
  intervals. We evaluate MBMs on two tasks: a semi-synthetic setting where ground
  truth metrics are available and a real-world hospital readmission prediction task.
  We find that MBMs consistently produce more accurate and lower variance estimates
  of model performance, particularly for small subpopulations.'
