abstract: The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a widely used device to monitor the electrical
  activity of the heart. To diagnose various heart abnormalities, ECG diagnosis algorithms
  have been developed and deep neural networks (DNN) have been shown to achieve significant
  performance. Most of the DNN architectures used for ECG diagnosis models are adopted
  from architectures developed for image or natural language domain, and their performances
  have improved year by year in the original domains. In this work, we conduct in-depth
  benchmarking of DNN architectures for ECG diagnosis. Using three datasets, we compared
  nine DNN architectures for both multi-label classification settings evaluated with
  ROC- AUC score and multi-class classification settings evaluated with F1 scores.
  The results showed that one of classical architectures, ResNet-18, performed consistently
  better over most of architectures, suggesting there is room for developing DNN architecture
  tailored for ECG domain.
