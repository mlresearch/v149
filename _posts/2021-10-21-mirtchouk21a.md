abstract: Large biomedical datasets can contain thousands of variables, creating challenges
  for machine learn-ing tasks such as causal inference and prediction. Feature selection
  and ranking methods have been developed to reduce the number of variables and determine
  which are most important. However in many cases, such as in classification from
  diagnosis codes, ontologies, and controlled vocabularies, we must choose not only
  which variables to include but also at what level of granularity. ICD-9 codes, for
  example, are arranged in a hierarchy, and a user must decide at what level codes
  should be analyzed. Thus it is currently up to a researcher to decide whether to
  use any diagnosis of diabetes or whether to distinguish between specific forms,
  such as Type 2 diabetes with renal complications versus without mention of complications.
  Currently, there is no existing method that can automatically make this determination
  and methods for feature selection do not exploit this hierarchical information,
  which is found in other areas including nutrition (hierarchies of foods), and bioinformatics
  (hierarchical relationship of genes). To address this, we propose a novel Hierarchical
  Information Criterion (HIC) that builds on mutual information and allows fully automated
  abstraction of variables. Using HIC allows us to rank hierarchical features and
  select the ones with the highest score. We show that this significantly improves
  performance by an average AUROC of 0.053 over traditional feature selection methods
  and hand crafted features on two mortality prediction tasks using MIMIC-III ICU
  data. Our method also improves on the state of the art (Fu et al., 2019) with an
  AUROC increase from 0.819 to 0.887
