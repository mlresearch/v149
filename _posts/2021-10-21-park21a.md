abstract: 'Question Answering (QA) is a widely-used framework for developing and evaluating
  an intelligent machine. In this light, QA on Electronic Health Records (EHR), namely
  EHR QA, can work as a crucial milestone towards developing an intelligent agent
  in healthcare. EHR data are typically stored in a relational database, which can
  also be converted to a directed acyclic graph, allowing two approaches for EHR QA:
  Table-based QA and Knowledge Graph-based QA. We hypothesize that the graph-based
  approach is more suitable for EHR QA as graphs can represent relations between entities
  and values more naturally compared to tables, which essentially require JOIN operations.
  In this paper, we propose a graph-based EHR QA where natural language queries are
  converted to SPARQL instead of SQL. To validate our hypothesis, we create four EHR
  QA datasets (graph- based VS table-based, and simplified database schema VS original
  database schema), based on a table-based dataset MIMICSQL. We test both a simple
  Seq2Seq model and a state-of-the-art EHR QA model on all datasets where the graph-based
  datasets facilitated up to 34% higher accuracy than the table-based dataset without
  any modification to the model architectures. Finally, all datasets are open-sourced
  to encourage further EHR QA research in both directions'
