abstract: Contextual bandits often provide simple and effective personalization in
  decision making problems, making them popular tools to deliver personalized interventions
  in mobile health as well as other health applications. However, when bandits are
  deployed in the context of a scientific study—e.g. a clinical trial to test if a
  mobile health intervention is effective—the aim is not only to personalize for an
  individual, but also to determine, with sufficient statistical power, whether or
  not the system’s intervention is effective. It is essential to assess the effectiveness
  of the intervention before broader deployment for better resource allocation. The
  two objectives are often deployed under different model assumptions, making it hard
  to determine how achieving the personalization and statistical power affect each
  other. In this work, we develop general meta-algorithms to modify existing algorithms
  such that sufficient power is guaranteed while still improving each user’s well-being.
  We also demonstrate that our meta-algorithms are robust to various model mis-specifications
  possibly appearing in statistical studies, thus providing a valuable tool to study
  designers.
