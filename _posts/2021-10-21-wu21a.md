abstract: 'Recurrent neural network based solutions are increasingly being used in
  the analysis of longitudinal Electronic Health Record data. However, most works
  focus on prediction accuracy and neglect prediction uncertainty. We propose Deep
  Kernel Accelerated Failure Time models for the time-to-event prediction task, enabling
  uncertainty-awareness of the prediction by a pipeline of a recurrent neural network
  and a sparse Gaussian Process. Furthermore, a deep metric learning based pre-training
  step is adapted to enhance the proposed model. Our model shows better point estimate
  performance than recurrent neural network based baselines in experiments on two
  real-world datasets. More importantly, the predictive variance from our model can
  be used to quantify the uncertainty estimates of the time-to-event prediction: Our
  model delivers better performance when it is more confident in its prediction. Compared
  to related methods, such as Monte Carlo Dropout, our model offers better uncertainty
  estimates by leveraging an analytical solution and is more computationally efficient.'
