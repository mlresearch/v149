abstract: Researchers require timely access to real-world longitudinal electronic
  health records (EHR) to develop, test, validate, and implement machine learning
  solutions that improve the quality and efficiency of healthcare. In contrast, health
  systems value deeply patient privacy and data security. De-identified EHRs do not
  adequately address the needs of health systems, as de-identified data are susceptible
  to re-identification and its volume is also limited. Synthetic EHRs offer a potential
  solution. In this paper, we propose EHR Variational Autoencoder (EVA) for synthesizing
  sequences of discrete EHR encounters (e.g., clinical visits) and encounter features
  (e.g., diagnoses, medications, procedures). We illustrate that EVA can produce realistic
  EHR sequences, account for individual differences among patients, and can be conditioned
  on specific disease conditions, thus enabling disease-specific studies. We design
  efficient, accurate inference algorithms by combining stochastic gradient Markov
  Chain Monte Carlo with amortized variational inference. We assess the utility of
  the methods on large real-world EHR repositories containing over 250, 000 patients.
  Our experiments, which include user studies with knowledgeable clinicians, indicate
  the generated EHR sequences are realistic. We confirmed the performance of predictive
  models trained on the synthetic data are similar with those trained on real EHRs.
  Additionally, our findings indicate that augmenting real data with synthetic EHRs
  results in the best predictive performance - improving the best baseline by as much
  as 8% in top-20 recall.
