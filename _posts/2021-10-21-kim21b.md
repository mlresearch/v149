abstract: In silico prediction of drug-target interactions (DTI) is significant for
  drug discovery be-cause it can largely reduce timelines and costs in the drug development
  process. Specifically, deep learning-based DTI approaches have been shown promising
  results in terms of accuracy and low cost for the prediction. However, they pay
  little attention to the interpretability of their prediction results and feature-level
  interactions between a drug and a target. In this study, we propose a novel interpretable
  framework that can provide reasonable cues for the interaction sites. To this end,
  we elaborately design a gated cross-attention mechanism that crossly attends drug
  and target features by constructing explicit interactions between these features.
  The gating function in the method enables neural models to focus on salient regions
  over entire sequences of drugs and proteins, and the byproduct from the function,
  which is the attention map, could serve as interpretable factors. The experimental
  results show the efficacy of the proposed method in two DTI datasets. Additionally,
  we show that gated cross-attention can sensitively react to the mutation, and this
  result could provide insights into the identification of novel drugs targeting mutant
  proteins.
