abstract: 'Semi-supervised image classification has shown substantial progress in
  learning from limited labeled data, but recent advances remain largely untested
  for clinical applications. Motivated by the urgent need to improve timely diagnosis
  of life-threatening heart conditions, especially aortic stenosis, we develop a benchmark
  dataset to assess semi-supervised approaches to two tasks relevant to cardiac ultrasound
  (echocardiogram) interpretation: view classification and disease severity classification.
  We find that a state-of-the-art method called MixMatch achieves promising gains
  in heldout accuracy on both tasks, learning from a large volume of truly unlabeled
  images as well as a labeled set collected at great expense to achieve better performance
  than is possible with the labeled set alone. We further pursue patient-level diagnosis
  prediction, which requires aggregating across hundreds of images of diverse view
  types, most of which are irrelevant, to make a coherent prediction. The best patient-level
  performance is achieved by new methods that prioritize diagnosis predictions from
  images that are predicted to be clinically-relevant views and transfer knowledge
  from the view task to the diagnosis task. We hope our released dataset and evaluation
  framework inspire further improvements in multi-task semi-supervised learning for
  clinical applications.'
