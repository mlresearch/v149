abstract: 'Precision health monitoring is facilitated by long-term data collection
  that establishes a health baseline and enables the detection of deviations from
  it. With the advent of the Internet of Things, monitoring of daily excreta from
  a toilet is emerging as a promising tool to achieve the long-term collection of
  physiological data. This paper describes a stool image analysis approach that accurately
  and efficiently tracks stool form and visible blood content using a Smart Toilet.
  The Smart Toilet, can discreetly image stools in toilet plumbing outside the purview
  of the user. We constructed a stool image dataset with 3,275 images, spanning all
  seven types of the Bristol Stool Form Scale, a widely used metric for stool classification.
  We used ground-truth data obtained through the labeling of our dataset by two gastroenterologists.
  We addressed three limitations associated with the application of computer-vision
  techniques to a smart toilet system: (i) uneven separability between different stool
  form categories; (i) class imbalance in the dataset; (ii) limited computational
  resources in the microcontroller integrated with the Smart Toilet. We present results
  on the use of class-balanced loss, and hierarchical and compact convolutional neural
  network (CNN) architectures for training a stool-form classifier. We also present
  results obtained using perceptual color quantization coupled with mutual information
  to optimize the color- feature space for the detection of stool images with gross
  (visible) blood content. For the classification of stool-form, we achieve a balanced
  accuracy of 81.66% using a hierarchical CNN based on MobileNetV2. For gross blood
  detection, the decision tree (DT) classifier provides 74.64% balanced accuracy.'
