abstract: 'Despite the success of deep neural networks in chest X-ray (CXR) diagnosis,
  supervised learning only allows the prediction of disease classes that were seen
  during training. At inference, these networks cannot predict an unseen disease class.
  Incorporating a new class requires the collection of labeled data, which is not
  a trivial task, especially for less frequently-occurring diseases. As a result,
  it becomes inconceivable to build a model that can diagnose all possible disease
  classes. Here, we propose a multi-label generalized zero shot learning (CXR-ML-GZSL)
  network that can simultaneously predict multiple seen and unseen diseases in CXR
  images. Given an input image, CXR-ML-GZSL learns a visual representation guided
  by the inputâ€™s corresponding semantics extracted from a rich medical text corpus.
  Towards this ambitious goal, we propose to map both visual and semantic modalities
  to a latent feature space using a novel learning objective. The objective ensures
  that (i) the most relevant labels for the query image are ranked higher than irrelevant
  labels, (ii) the network learns a visual representation that is aligned with its
  semantics in the latent feature space, and (iii) the mapped semantics preserve their
  original inter-class representation. The network is end-to-end trainable and requires
  no independent pre-training for the offline feature extractor. Experiments on the
  NIH Chest X-ray dataset show that our network outperforms two strong baselines in
  terms of recall, precision, f1 score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic
  curve. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/nyuad-cai/CXR-ML-GZSL.git'
