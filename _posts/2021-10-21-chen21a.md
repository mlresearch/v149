abstract: A major obstacle to the integration of deep learning models for chest x-ray
  interpretation into clinical settings is the lack of understanding of their failure
  modes. In this work, we first investigate whether there are patient subgroups that
  chest x-ray models are likely to misclassify. We find that patient age and the radiographic
  finding of lung lesion, pneumothorax or support devices are statistically relevant
  features for predicting misclassification for some chest x-ray models. Second, we
  develop misclassification predictors on chest x-ray models using their outputs and
  clinical features. We find that our best performing misclassification identifier
  achieves an AUROC close to 0.9 for most diseases. Third, employing our misclassification
  identifiers, we develop a corrective algorithm to selectively flip model predictions
  that have high likelihood of misclassification at inference time. We observe F1
  improvement on the prediction of Consolidation (0.008 [95% CI 0.005, 0.010]) and
  Edema (0.003, [95% CI 0.001, 0.006]). By carrying out our investigation on ten distinct
  and high- performing chest x-ray models, we are able to derive insights across model
  architectures and offer a generalizable framework applicable to other medical imaging
  tasks.
