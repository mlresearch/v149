abstract: 'We explore how to quantify uncertainty when designing predictive models
  for healthcare to provide well-calibrated results. Uncertainty quantification and
  calibration are critical in medicine, as one must not only accommodate the variability
  of the underlying physiology, but adjust to the uncertain data collection and reporting
  process. This occurs not only on the context of electronic health records (i.e.,
  the clinical documentation process), but on mobile health as well (i.e., user specific
  self-tracking patterns must be accounted for). In this work, we show that accurate
  uncertainty estimation is directly relevant to an important health application:
  the prediction of menstrual cycle length, based on self-tracked information. We
  take advantage of a flexible generative model that accommodates under-dispersed
  distributions via two degrees of freedom to fit the mean and variance of the observed
  cycle lengths. From a machine learning perspective, our work showcases how flexible
  generative models can not only provide state-of-the art predictive accuracy, but
  enable well-calibrated predictions. From a healthcare perspective, we demonstrate
  that with flexible generative models, not only can we accommodate the idiosyncrasies
  of mobile health data, but we can also adjust the predictive uncertainty to per-user
  cycle length patterns. We evaluate the proposed model in real-world cycle length
  data collected by one of the most popular menstrual trackers worldwide, and demonstrate
  how the proposed generative model provides accurate and well-calibrated cycle length
  predictions. Providing meaningful, less uncertain cycle length predictions is beneficial
  for menstrual health researchers, mobile health users and developers, as it may
  help design more usable mobile health solutions.'
