abstract: Social and Behavioral Determinants of Health (SBDHs) are environmental and
  behavioral factors that have a profound impact on health and related outcomes. Given
  their importance, physicians document SBDHs of their patients in Electronic Health
  Records (EHRs). However, SBDHs are mostly documented in unstructured EHR notes.
  Determining the status of the SBDHs requires manually reviewing the notes which
  can be a tedious process. Therefore, there is a need to automate identifying the
  patients’ SBDH status in EHR notes. In this work, we created MIMIC-SBDH, the first
  publicly available dataset of EHR notes annotated for patients’ SBDH status. Specifically,
  we annotated 7, 025 discharge summary notes for the status of 7 SBDHs as well as
  marked SBDH-related keywords. Using this annotated data for training and evaluation,
  we evaluated the performance of three machine learning models (Random Forest, XGBoost,
  and Bio-ClinicalBERT) on the task of identifying SBDH status in EHR notes. The performance
  ranged from the lowest 0.69 F1 score for Drug Use to the highest 0.96 F1 score for
  Community-Present. In addition to standard evaluation metrics such as the F1 score,
  we evaluated four capabilities that a model must possess to perform well on the
  task using the CheckList tool (Ribeiro et al., 2020). The results revealed several
  shortcomings of the models. Our results highlighted the need to perform more capability-centric
  evaluations in addition to standard metric comparisons.
