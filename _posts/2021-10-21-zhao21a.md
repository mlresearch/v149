abstract: 'Many variables useful for clinical research (e.g. patient disease state,
  treatment regimens) are trapped in free-text clinical notes. Structuring such variables
  for downstream use typically involves a tedious process in which domain experts
  manually search through long clinical timelines. Natural language processing systems
  present an opportunity for automating this workflow, but algorithms still have trouble
  accurately parsing the most complex patient cases, which may be best deferred to
  experts. In this work, we present a framework that automatically structures simple
  patient cases, but when required, iteratively requests human input, specifically
  a label for a single note in the patientâ€™s timeline that would decrease uncertainty
  in model output. Our method provides a lightweight way to leverage domain experts.
  We test our system on two tasks from a cohort of oncology patients: identification
  of the date of (i) metastasis onset and (ii) oral therapy start. Compared to standard
  search heuristics, we show we can reduce 80% of model errors with less than 15%
  of the manual annotation effort that may otherwise be required.'
