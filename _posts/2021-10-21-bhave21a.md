abstract: 'Modeling EHR data is of significant interest in a broad range of applications
  including prediction of future conditions or building latent representations of
  patient history. This can be challenging because EHR data is multivariate and irregularly
  sampled. Traditional treatments of EHR data involve handling irregular sampling
  by imputation or discretization. In this work, we model the full longitudinal history
  of a patient using a generative multivariate point process that simultaneously:
  (1) Models irregularly sampled events probabilistically without discretization or
  interpolation (2) Has a closed-form likelihood, making training straightforward
  (3) Encodes dependence between times and events with an approach inspired by competing
  risk models (4) Allows for direct sampling. We show improved performance on next-event
  prediction compared to existing approaches. Our pro- posed framework could potentially
  be used in many different contexts including prediction, generation of synthetic
  data and building latent representations of patient history.'
