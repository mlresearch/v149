abstract: 'Deriving true clinical utility from models trained on multiple hospitals’
  data is a key challenge in the adoption of Federated Learning (FL) systems in support
  of clinical collaborations. When utility is equated to predictive power, population
  heterogeneity between centers becomes a key bottleneck in training performant models.
  Nevertheless, there are other aspects to clinical utility that have frequently been
  overlooked in this context. Among them, we argue for the importance of understanding
  how a collaboration may be affecting the quality of a center’s predictions. Insights
  into how and when external knowledge is being useful can lead to strategic decisions
  by stakeholders, such as better allocation of local resources or even identifying
  best practices outside of the current organization. We take a step towards deriving
  such utility through FedeRated CLassifier Selection (FRCLS, pronounced “freckles”):
  an algorithm that reuses classifiers trained in outside institutions. It identifies
  regions of the feature space where the collaborators’ models will outperform the
  local center’s classifier, and can provide interpretable rules to describe these
  regions of beneficial expertise. We apply FRCLS to a sepsis prediction task in two
  different hospital systems, demonstrating its benefits in terms of understanding
  the types of patients for which the collaboration is useful and reasoning about
  the strategic decisions that may stem out of these analyses.'
